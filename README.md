ASCII
=====

This is the opensource repository for the ASCII website (fancy, I know, with its own MIT Licence)

Feel free to create an Issue for any features you would like to see. Or if you don't like how something is done. Or even
if you think you have a better idea for the design. Everyone's say counts. 

What would be even better is if you send a pull request, with the implementation of feature X that you would like to
see. 

All contributions, large and small are welcome. But please do create a Issue first before sending a Pull request
titled "Changed background to RED. I like red" :)

Few things to note
- Don't sweat about opening an Issue. Its no big deal. Features requests/bugs/anything is welcome
- Please dont start coding on a feature before opening an Issue and discussing it

##FAQ
- _Wow man. talk about overkill._   
yes. noted. moving on :)_

- _So why the trouble for something as small as this?_  
because this is how almost **ALL** open source projects are done. It is good practice. And because we are big fans
of 'doing it properly'. On a side note now you dont get to say "Why didnt you do this?", but its rather 
"Why didnt **I** do this and send a pull request"
